Encapsulation
-
Encapsulation it's storing data structures in one class, with multiple methods to manipulate them.

Its advantages:
- Can be easily stored in databases, files etc.
- Can be easily converted to a JSON structure
- Can hide values from illegal access
- Models can have multiple methods available for all classes instead of creating one in each class that needs them

Its disadvantages:
- Without using encapsulation properly, code can start being unreadable and hard to use
